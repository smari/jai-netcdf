# Jai-NetCDF

These are Jai bindings for the [NetCDF](https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf-c/current/index.html) library.
They are tested with NetCDF 4.9.2 on Linux.

Bindings are generated with `generate.jai`. Use `build.sh` to obtain a copy of NetCDF sources
and build them before trying to generate. You'll also need these in order for the bindings to work.

In `module.jai`, there are a number of convenient functions that wrap the NetCDF library functions
in a more Jai-like access pattern.
